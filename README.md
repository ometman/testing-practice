<h3> Testing-Practice <h3>
**Testing-Practice** is a simple and brief exercise to test JS code by writing a test function using 'Jest'. It follows the AAA pattern for unit testing.

## How to Use:

1. In order to run this exercise you need:
- Git.
- An IDE (e.g. VS Code)
- The Integrated CLI or Git Bash. 

## Getting Started:

1. - Clone this repository to your desired director:
2. - Run: git clone gh repo clone ometman/testing-practice
3. - Make sure node is installed
4. - Initialize the director by running:
     - npm init -y
5.  Install jest by running the following:
    -- npm install --save-dev jest
6.  Now, open the package.json do the following under scrpits:
      - Change the test call to: "test": "jest" 
      - Add: "watch": "jest --watch"
      - save the changes
7. You can now run the following:
   - npm run watch (for real-time running of the test as you change the code)
   - npm test (for one time running of the test, after making changes)


## Happy Coding!
